# Bicycle ðŸš²

Bicycle ðŸš² is a framework for defining database schemas whose access patterns are generated as code and compiled into each server binary. 

> We're striving to reduce dynamic query parsing at run time.

## Usage

A Bicycle schema is defined in a simple `.proto` file like so:

```proto
// schema.proto
syntax = "proto3";
package bicycle;

message Dog {
  string pk = 1;

  string name = 2;
  uint32 age = 3;
  string breed = 4;
}
```

We don't distribute the binary yet but if you clone down this repository you can play around with it:

```bash
## clone
git clone git@github.com:ordinarylabs/bicycle.git && cd bicycle

## generate your `./out/server` and `./out/bicycle.proto`
cargo run --package bicycle_cli -- create path/to/your/schema.proto
```

That will create a server binary and proto file for your consuming services. So in the `cli/out/` you'll have `server` and `bicycle.proto`.

The `bicycle.proto` is what any developer who is familiar with gRPC can use to code-gen and build a client to the database. Right now, the database
is _very_ light weight and has _no_ administration infrastructure, permissions or auth; I get away with this because I'm only ever running it in private
subnets within the same VPCs on AWS and stuff. But there is always room for evolution. 

## Running

Once RocksDB is finally done building (holy fuck that takes way too long and I need to figure out how to like cache it or some do some 
other Rustacean magic to make it stop), you should be able to run the server with:

```bash
./out/server
```

## Clients

When you run the `create` command, it will take in your `schema.proto` and produce an `./out/bicycle.proto` that looks something like this:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
package bicycle;

message Dogs { 
  repeated Dog dogs = 1; 
}
message Dog {
  string pk = 1;
  string name = 2;
  uint32 age = 3;
  string breed = 4;
}

message IndexQuery {
  oneof expression {
    string eq = 1;
    string gte = 2;
    string lte = 3;
    string begins_with = 4;
  }
}

message Empty {}

service Bicycle {
  rpc GetDogsByPk(IndexQuery) returns (Dogs) {}
  rpc DeleteDogsByPk(IndexQuery) returns (Empty) {}
  rpc PutDog(Dog) returns (Empty) {}
  rpc BatchPutDogs(Dogs) returns (Empty) {}
}
```

Because the database server is just a gRPC server, you can use all native gRPC libraries for any language you like.
and you can also roll over to your preferred gRPC GUI client, type in `localhost::50051`, _AND_ because we implement
server reflection, when you plug in the URL it will automatically load up all your available RPCs (assuming your client GUI supports that).

## Example

Basically we have 4 RPCs for each model:

- `GetXByPk`
- `DeleteXByPk`
- `PutX`
- `BatchPutX`

And then you have the `IndexQuery` helper which basically allows you to do key-range queries. 

Here are the really basic examples:

```bash
## PutDog
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{
  "pk": "DOG#1",
  "name": "Rover",
  "age": 3,
  "breed": "Golden Retriever"
}' localhost:50051 bicycle.Bicycle.PutDog

## BatchPutDogs
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{
  "dogs": [
    {
      "pk": "DOG#2",
      "name": "Buddy",
      "age": 2,
      "breed": "Labrador"
    },
    {
      "pk": "DOG#3",
      "name": "Max",
      "age": 4,
      "breed": "Poodle"
    }
  ]
}' localhost:50051 bicycle.Bicycle.BatchPutDogs

## GetDogs
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"begins_with": "DOG#"}' localhost:50051 bicycle.Bicycle.GetDogsByPk

## DeleteDogs
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"eq": "DOG#3"}' localhost:50051 bicycle.Bicycle.DeleteDogsByPk
```

there isn't really a thing right now. it's kinda just one person rn with a few others maybe joining. we gotta set up a CLA or something i think. but check back in.

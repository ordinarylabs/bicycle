Protobuf defined database framework.

## Install

Before installing `bicycle` you'll need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [protoc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) installed.

```bash
cargo install bicycle
```

## Usage

A Bicycle schema is defined in a simple `.proto` file.

```protobuf
// schema.proto
syntax = "proto3";
package bicycle;

message Dog {
  string pk = 1;

  string name = 2;
  uint32 age = 3;
  string breed = 4;
}
```

Run the `build` command to generate your Bicycle components.

```bash
bicycle build schema.proto
```

## Server

### Running

You can now run the server binary with the following command.

```bash
./__bicycle__/target/release/bicycle_server
```

### Testing RPCs

To test some basic CRUD you can use [gRPCurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl)

```bash
## PutDog
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{
  "pk": "1",
  "name": "Rover",
  "age": 3,
  "breed": "Golden Retriever"
}' 0.0.0.0:50051 bicycle.Bicycle.PutDog

## BatchPutDogs
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{
  "dogs": [
    {
      "pk": "2",
      "name": "Buddy",
      "age": 2,
      "breed": "Labrador"
    },
    {
      "pk": "3",
      "name": "Max",
      "age": 4,
      "breed": "Poodle"
    }
  ]
}' 0.0.0.0:50051 bicycle.Bicycle.BatchPutDogs

## GetDogs
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"begins_with": ""}' 0.0.0.0:50051 bicycle.Bicycle.GetDogsByPk

## DeleteDogs
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"eq": "3"}' 0.0.0.0:50051 bicycle.Bicycle.DeleteDogsByPk
```

## Clients

### Rust

The Rust client code is generated by default and can be added to any Rust project as a dependency

```toml
# my-rust-app/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
bicycle = { package = "bicycle_core", path = "__bicycle__/core" }
tokio = { version = "1.36.0", features = ["rt", "macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```

Call the Bicycle server from your Rust app

```rust
// my-rust-app/src/main.rs
use bicycle;
use bicycle::proto::{bicycle_client::BicycleClient, index_query::Expression, Dog, IndexQuery};
use bicycle::tonic::Request;

use std::error::Error;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // establish connection to remote Bicycle server
    let mut client = BicycleClient::connect("http://0.0.0.0:50051").await?;

    // write a dog to remote Bicycle server
    client
        .put_dog(Request::new(Dog {
            pk: "4".to_string(),
            name: "Sam".to_string(),
            age: 6,
            breed: "Labrador".to_string(),
        }))
        .await?;

    // get dog back from remote Bicycle server
    let dogs = client
        .get_dogs_by_pk(Request::new(IndexQuery {
            expression: Some(Expression::Eq("4".to_string())),
        }))
        .await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Other Languages

You can also use the ` ./__bicycle__/proto/bicycle.proto` to codegen your own database clients for any other language. Because the Bicycle server is just a gRPC server, any language with gRPC support also has Bicycle client support. 

```protobuf
//  ./__bicycle__/proto/bicycle.proto
syntax = "proto3";
package bicycle;

message Dogs { 
  repeated Dog dogs = 1; 
}
message Dog {
  string pk = 1;
  string name = 2;
  uint32 age = 3;
  string breed = 4;
}

message IndexQuery {
  oneof expression {
    string eq = 1;
    string gte = 2;
    string lte = 3;
    string begins_with = 4;
  }
}

message Empty {}

service Bicycle {
  rpc GetDogsByPk(IndexQuery) returns (Dogs) {}
  rpc DeleteDogsByPk(IndexQuery) returns (Empty) {}
  rpc PutDog(Dog) returns (Empty) {}
  rpc BatchPutDogs(Dogs) returns (Empty) {}
}
```

### Desktop GUIs

Bicycle servers also implement [server reflection](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/server-reflection.md), so you can roll over to your preferred gRPC desktop client (i.e Postman, BloomRPC), type in `0.0.0.0::50051`, and they should be able to automatically load up all your RPCs.

## SPROCS

Stored procedures are supported and can be written in Rust built for the `wasm32-wasi` target. Currently only `stdio` is inherited from the host context and the additional WASI APIs are not supported (this means your `println!()`s will show up on the host but you don't have access to things like the file system).

`bicycle sproc` commands for building with `--lang rust` depend on `cargo-wasi` which can be installed using `cargo install cargo-wasi` (details [here](https://bytecodealliance.github.io/cargo-wasi/install.html)).

### Definition

For this example we want to create a stored procedure that will return us only the `Dog`'s names. To create a new SPROC we run the following

```bash
cargo new dog-names-proc
```

Some additional items need to be added to the `Cargo.toml`. The host shims are provided by the build output in `__bicycle__` and will need to be added as a dependency. You will also need to set your build target's name to `"proc"` and optionally adjust the release profile to produce smaller WASM binaries.

```toml
# dog-names-proc/Cargo.toml

## shims to interact more cleanly with the host functions
[dependencies]
bicycle = { package = "bicycle_shims", path = "__bicycle__/shims" }

## set the binary name to "proc" so the CLI can deploy it
[[bin]]
path = "src/main.rs"
name = "proc"

## recommended for smaller binaries
## also see: https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust
[profile.release]
strip = true
lto = true
opt-level = 'z'
codegen-units = 1
```

For a basic SPROC example we have the following which uses the `recv_in` to get the dynamic input passed to the SPROC by the caller.

Once we have the "begins_with" argument from `recv_in` we use the `get_dogs_by_pk` shim to grab the requested `Dog`s from the host, map over just their names, and then send the output back to the host via `send_out`. Once the host captures the result of `send_out` they will forward it onto the caller.

**NOTE**: all SPROC I/O utilizes the [`Value`](https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/#value) protobuf type and `bicycle_shims` re-exports `prost-types` crate which provides the Rust implementation of the `Value` type for you.

```rust
// dog-names-proc/src/main.rs
use bicycle;
use bicycle::prost_types::{value::Kind, ListValue, Value};
use bicycle::proto::{index_query::Expression, Dogs, IndexQuery};
use bicycle::{recv_in, send_out};

use std::error::Error;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // get input from the host Bicycle server context, sent by caller
    let val: Option<Value> = recv_in()?;

    let mut begins_with = "".to_string();

    // extract "begins_with" from `Value`
    if let Some(Value {
        kind: Some(Kind::StructValue(struct_val)),
    }) = val
    {
        if let Some(Kind::StringValue(val)) = struct_val
            .fields
            .get("begins_with")
            .map(|v| v.kind.as_ref())
            .flatten()
        {
            begins_with = val.clone()
        }
    }

    // get dogs from the host Bicycle server
    let Dogs { dogs } = bicycle::get_dogs_by_pk(IndexQuery {
        expression: Some(Expression::BeginsWith(val)),
    })?;

    // build a list of dog names as `StringValue`s
    let names = dogs
        .into_iter()
        .map(|dog| Value {
            kind: Some(Kind::StringValue(dog.name)),
        })
        .collect::<Vec<Value>>();

    // set output for host Bicycle server to read in and send back to caller
    send_out(Some(Value {
        kind: Some(Kind::ListValue(ListValue { values: names })),
    }))
}
```

### Execution

To test the procedure as a one-off against your Bicycle server

```bash
bicycle sproc oneoff ./dog-names-proc --addr http://0.0.0.0:50051 --lang rust --args '{"begins_with": ""}'
```

To store the procedure on your Bicycle server for future execution

```bash
bicycle sproc deploy ./dog-names-proc --addr http://0.0.0.0:50051 --name dog-names-proc --lang rust
```

To execute a previously stored procedure on your Bicycle server

```bash
bicycle sproc exec --addr http://0.0.0.0:50051 --name dog-names-proc --args '{"begins_with": ""}'
```

## Embedding

In addition to the gRPC server based implementation, you can also use the generated Rust `core` functions without using gRPC at all. The query/storage formats remain protobuf, but without the remote server interaction.

You can import the core functionality into your project by adding the generated `bicycle_core` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`

```toml
# embedded-dogs/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
bicycle = { package = "bicycle_core", path = "__bicycle__/core" }
```

```rust
// embedded-dogs/src/main.rs
use bicycle;
use bicycle::proto::{index_query::Expression, Dog, IndexQuery};

use std::error::Error;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // write a dog to local Bicycle
    bicycle::put_dog(Dog {
        pk: "0".to_string(),
        name: "Ollie".to_string(),
        age: 7,
        breed: "Pitty".to_string(),
    })?;

    // get that dog back from local Bicycle
    let dogs = bicycle::get_dogs_by_pk(IndexQuery {
        expression: Some(Expression::Eq("0".to_string())),
    })?;

    Ok(())
}
```

Accelerating development and improving DevEx without sacrificing performance.

BicycleDB is a tool for compiling database servers with application models and access patterns built in at compile time; with protobuf as the storage and transport format, each database instance is a gRPC server compiled from Rust, backed by a RocksDB or SQLite storage engine.

## CLI

See the BicycleDB Manager CLI documentation [here](https://crates.io/crates/bicycle). For querying any of [these](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/awesome-grpc?tab=readme-ov-file#cli) should work.

## GUI

BicycleDB server support reflection, so any of [these](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/awesome-grpc?tab=readme-ov-file#gui) should work.

## Supported Features

- Key/Value storage and retrieval
- Range queries via `gte`, `lte` and `begins_with`
- Stored Procedures via WebAssembly (non-transactional)
- Embedding for offline usage or local storage
- Protobuf message nesting for "document-like" records

## Planned Features

- Built-in Relationships
- Events/Streaming
- Transactional SPROCs

## Examples

Check out example usage for SPROCs, embedding and Rust clients [here](https://github.com/ordinarylabs/bicycle/tree/main/examples).
